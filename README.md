# MIPSCPU  
### A single cycle (nopipeline) mips CPU.  
This simple mips CPU is done only for :  
1. Learning verilog.  
2. Learning implement of MIPS CPU and MIPS instructions coding.  
  
Up till now, it only supports mips core instruction and some other instructions.  
**Note: This mips is implemented mainly according textbook.**  
**Some details that not mentioned are implemented by my imagination.**  
**The implement might quite differ from real MIPS CPU.**  
**What's more, this is only for simulation and not support synthesize.**  
**To support synthesize, you should add extra IO.**

The instructions it support.  
1. add  
2. sub  
3. or  
4. and  
5. move  
6. beq  
7. slt  
8. j \(jump\)  
9. halt (11111100000000000000000000000000)  
10. andi  
11. addi  
12. ori
